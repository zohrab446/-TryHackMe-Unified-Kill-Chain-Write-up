# -TryHackMe-Unified-Kill-Chain-Write-up
The **Unified Kill Chain (UKC)** is an extended framework that merges the **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain** and **MITRE ATT&amp;CK** models.   It provides a more complete view of how cyber attacks progress — from initial access to the final objectives — and where defenders can detect and stop them.

### ⚙️ The 18 Stages  
Unlike the traditional 7-stage Cyber Kill Chain, the Unified Kill Chain includes **18 stages**, grouped into three main phases:

#### 1. **Initial Foothold**
- Reconnaissance  
- Weaponization  
- Delivery  
- Exploitation  
- Installation  

#### 2. **Network Propagation**
- Privilege Escalation  
- Internal Reconnaissance  
- Lateral Movement  
- Persistence  

#### 3. **Action on Objectives**
- Collection  
- Command & Control  
- Exfiltration  
- Impact  

Each phase connects attacker behavior with defensive detection opportunities.

### 💡 Key Insights
- The **Unified Kill Chain** bridges **offensive tactics** (how attackers think) and **defensive strategies** (how to detect & respond).  
- It’s a more realistic and modern approach compared to the traditional Cyber Kill Chain.  
- Understanding these stages helps blue teamers design **layered defense mechanisms**.

### 🧰 Tools Explored
- MITRE ATT&CK Framework  
- Wireshark / Packet Analysis  
- SIEM concepts (Splunk, ELK)  
- Threat Intelligence Sources

### 🧠 Reflection
> Completing this room gave me a deeper understanding of how modern attacks evolve and how defenders can intercept them across different stages.  
>  
> The Unified Kill Chain is not just a theoretical model — it’s a practical mindset for both **Red** and **Blue** teams.
